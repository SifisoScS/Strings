# C# Verbatim Strings

This repository serves as a guide to understanding and utilizing verbatim strings in C#. Verbatim strings are particularly useful when dealing with paths, regular expressions, multi-line text, and strings containing escape characters.

## What are Verbatim Strings?

Verbatim strings in C# start with the @ symbol. They allow you to include escape sequences as literal characters without the need for escaping them.

## Examples

### Verbatim String Literal

A verbatim string literal is denoted by prefixing the string with the @ symbol. It allows you to include escape sequences as literal characters without needing to escape them.

### Verbatim String with Escape Sequences

Verbatim strings ignore escape sequences and treat them as literal characters.

### Verbatim String with Multi-line Text

Verbatim strings can span multiple lines without using escape characters like \n.

### Multi-line Verbatim String (Poem)

Verbatim strings make it easy to include multi-line text, such as poems, without any special handling.

### Verbatim String with Quotes

You can include double quotes within a verbatim string without escaping them.
